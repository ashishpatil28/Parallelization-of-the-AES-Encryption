# Parallelization-of-the-AES-Encryption
Encryption of data has become an import part of data security. There are various
encryption algorithms created like AES, DES, Bluefish, Triple DES algorithms,etc. In this
project we aim towards creating a parallel version of the traditional AES using GCC 9.0 (min 4.5), OpenMP, Bash (for time analysis) .

If you want to have this project in your device then just copy paste the code and use the following command in your command prompt , make two text files and just input that command in your command prompt and you will get your output.
